## Looping Over Data Structures With for
#### Problem
You want to iterate over the elements in a collection in the manner of a traditional for loop.

#### Solution
There are many ways to loop over Scala collections, including for loops, while loops, and collection methods like foreach, map, flatMap, and more. This solution focuses primarily on the for loop.

Given a simple list:

```scala
val fruits = List("apple", "banana", "orange")
```
you can loop over the elements in the list and print them like this:

```scala
scala> for f <- fruits do println(f)
apple
banana
orange
```
That same approach works for all sequences, including List, Seq, Vector, Array, ArrayBuffer, etc.

When your algorithm requires multiple lines, use the same for loop syntax, and perform your work in a block inside curly braces:
```scala

scala> for f <- fruits do
     |      // imagine this requires multiple lines
     |      val s = f.toUpperCase
     |      println(s)
APPLE
BANANA
ORANGE
```
FOR LOOP COUNTERS
If you need access to a counter inside a for loop, use one of the following approaches. First, you can access the elements in a sequence with a counter like this:
```scala

for i <- 0 until fruits.length do
    println(s"$i is ${fruits(i)}")
```
That loops yields this output:
```scala

0 is apple
1 is banana
2 is orange
```
You rarely need to access sequence elements by their index, but when you do, this is one possible approach. Scala collections also offer a zipWithIndex method that you can use to create a loop counter:
```scala

for (fruit, index) <- fruits.zipWithIndex do
    println(s"$index is $fruit")

```
Its output is:
```scala

0 is apple
1 is banana
2 is orange

```

GENERATORS
On a related note, the following example shows how to use a Range to execute a loop three times:

```scala
scala> for i <- 1 to 3 do println(i)
1
2
3
```
The 1 to 3 portion of the loop creates a Range, as shown in the REPL:
```scala

scala> 1 to 3
res0: scala.collection.immutable.Range.Inclusive = Range(1, 2, 3)
```
Using a Range like this is known as using a generator. Recipe 4.2 demonstrates how to use this technique to create multiple loop counters.

LOOPING OVER A MAP
When iterating over keys and values in a Map, I find this to be the most concise and readable for loop:

```scala
val names = Map(
    "firstName" -> "Robert",
    "lastName" -> "Goren"
)
for (k,v) <- names do println(s"key: $k, value: $v")
```

The REPL shows its output:
```scala

scala> for (k,v) <- names do println(s"key: $k, value: $v")
key: firstName, value: Robert
key: lastName, value: Goren
```
## Creating a New Collection From an Existing Collection With for/yield
#### Problem
You want to create a new collection from an existing collection by applying an algorithm (and potentially one or more guards) to each element in the original collection.

#### Solution
Use a yield statement with a for loop to create a new collection from an existing collection. For instance, given an array of lowercase strings:

```scala
scala> val names = List("chris", "ed", "maurice")
val names: List[String] = List(chris, ed, maurice)

```

you can create a new array of capitalized strings by combining yield with a for loop and a simple algorithm:

```scala
scala> val capNames = for name <- names yield name.capitalize
val capNames: List[String] = List(Chris, Ed, Maurice)
```
Using a for loop with a yield statement is known as a for-comprehension.

If your algorithm requires multiple lines of code, perform the work in a block after the yield keyword, manually specifying the type of the resulting variable, or not:
```scala
// [1] declare the type of `lengths`
val lengths: List[Int] = for name <- names yield
    // imagine that this body requires multiple lines of code
    name.length

// [2] don’t declare the type of `lengths`
val lengths = for name <- names yield
    // imagine that this body requires multiple lines of code
    name.length

```

Both approaches yield the same result:

```scala
List[Int] = List(5, 2, 7)
```
Both parts of your for-comprehension can be as complicated as necessary. Here’s a larger example:

```scala
val xs = List(1,2,3)
val ys = List(4,5,6)
val zs = List(7,8,9)

val a = for
    x <- xs
    if x > 2
    y <- ys
    z <- zs
    if y * z < 45
yield
    val b = x + y
    val c = b * z
    c
```
That for-comprehension yields the following result:

```scala
a: List[Int] = List(49, 56, 63, 56, 64, 63)
```
A for-comprehension can even be the complete body of a method:

```scala
def between3and10(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] =
    for
        x <- xs
        if x >= 3
        if x <= 10
    yield x

between3and10(List(1,3,7,11))   // List(3, 7)

```
## Using the if Construct Like a Ternary Operator
#### Problem
You’re familiar with Java’s special ternary operator syntax:

int absValue = (a < 0) ? -a : a;
and you’d like to know what the Scala equivalent is.

#### Solution
This is a bit of a trick problem, because unlike Java, in Scala there is no special ternary operator; just use an if/else/then expression:

```scala
val a = 1
val absValue = if a < 0 then -a else a
```
Because an if expression returns a value, you can embed it into a print statement:

```scala
println(if a == 0 then "a" else "b")
```
You can also use it in another expression, such as this portion of a hashCode method:

```scala
hash = hash * prime + (if name == null then 0 else name.hashCode)
```
The fact that if/else expressions return a value also lets you write concise methods:
```scala

// Version 1: one-line style
def abs(x: Int) = if x >= 0 then x else -x
def max(a: Int, b: Int) = if a > b then a else b

// Version 2: the method body on a separate line, if you prefer
def abs(x: Int) =
    if x >= 0 then x else -x

def max(a: Int, b: Int) =
    if a > b then a else b
```

## Using a Match Expression Like a switch Statement
#### Problem
You have a situation where you want to create something like a simple Java integer-based switch statement, such as matching the days in a week, months in a year, and other situations where an integer maps to a result.

#### Solution
To use a Scala match expression like a simple, integer-based switch statement, use this approach:
```scala

import scala.annotation.switch

// `i` is an integer
(i: @switch) match
    case 0 => println("Sunday")
    case 1 => println("Monday")
    case 2 => println("Tuesday")
    case 3 => println("Wednesday")
    case 4 => println("Thursday")
    case 5 => println("Friday")
    case 6 => println("Saturday")
    // catch the default with a variable so you can print it
    case whoa  => println(s"Unexpected case: ${whoa.toString}")
```
That example shows how to produce a side-effect action (println) based on a match. A more functional approach is to return a value from a match expression:
```scala

import scala.annotation.switch

// `i` is an integer
val day = (i: @switch) match
    case 0 => "Sunday"
    case 1 => "Monday"
    case 2 => "Tuesday"
    case 3 => "Wednesday"
    case 4 => "Thursday"
    case 5 => "Friday"
    case 6 => "Saturday"
    case _ => "invalid day"   // the default, catch-all
```
THE @SWITCH ANNOTATION
When writing simple match expressions like this, it’s recommended to use the @switch annotation, as shown. This annotation provides a warning at compile time if the switch can’t be compiled to a tableswitch or lookupswitch. Compiling your match expression to a tableswitch or lookupswitch is better for performance because it results in a branch table rather than a decision tree. When a value is given to the expression, it can jump directly to the result rather than working through the decision tree.

The Scala @switch annotation documentation states:

“If (this annotation is) present, the compiler will verify that the match has been compiled to a tableswitch or lookupswitch, and issue an error if it instead compiles into a series of conditional expressions.”

The effect of the @switch annotation is demonstrated with a simple example. First, place the following code in a file named SwitchDemo.scala:
```scala

// Version 1 - compiles to a tableswitch
import scala.annotation.switch

class SwitchDemo:
    val i = 1
    val x = (i: @switch) match
        case 1 => "One"
        case 2 => "Two"
        case 3 => "Three"
        case _ => "Other"
```
Then compile the code as usual:

```scala
$ scalac SwitchDemo.scala
```
Compiling this class produces no warnings and creates the SwitchDemo.class output file. Next, disassemble that file with this javap command:

```scala
$ javap -c SwitchDemo
```
The output from this command shows a tableswitch, like this:
```scala

16: tableswitch   { // 1 to 3
             1: 44
             2: 52
             3: 60
       default: 68
  }
```
This shows that Scala was able to optimize your match expression to a tableswitch. (This is a good thing.)

Next, make a minor change to the code, replacing the integer literal 1 with a value:

```scala

import scala.annotation.switch

// Version 2 - leads to a compiler warning
class SwitchDemo:
    val i = 1
    val one = 1               // added
    val x = (i: @switch) match
        case one  => "One"    // replaced the '1'
        case 2    => "Two"
        case 3    => "Three"
        case _    => "Other"
```
Again, compile the code with scalac, but right away you’ll see a warning message:
```scala

$ scalac SwitchDemo.scala
SwitchDemo.scala:7: warning: could not emit switch for @switch annotated match
  val x = (i: @switch) match {
               ^
one warning found
```
This warning message means that neither a tableswitch nor lookupswitch could be generated for the match expression. You can confirm this by running the javap command on the SwitchDemo.class file that was generated. When you look at that output, you’ll see that the tableswitch shown in the previous example is now gone.

In his book, Scala In Depth (Manning), Joshua Suereth states that the following conditions must be true for Scala to apply the tableswitch optimization:

- The matched value must be a known integer.

- The matched expression must be “simple.” It can’t contain any type checks, if statements, or extractors.

- The expression must also have its value available at compile time.

-There should be more than two case statements.

## Matching Multiple Conditions with One Case Statement
#### Problem
You have a situation where several match conditions require that the same business logic be executed, and rather than repeating your business logic for each case, you’d like to use one copy of the business logic for the matching conditions.

#### Solution
Place the match conditions that invoke the same business logic on one line, separated by the | (pipe) character:
```scala

// `i` is an Int
i match
    case 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 => println("odd")
    case 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 => println("even")
    case _ => println("too big")
```
This same syntax works with strings and other types. Here’s an example based on a String match:

```scala
val cmd = "stop"
cmd match
    case "start" | "go" => println("starting")
    case "stop" | "quit" | "exit" => println("stopping")
    case _ => println("doing nothing")
```
This example shows how to match multiple objects on each case statement:

```scala
enum Command:
    case Start, Go, Stop, Whoa

import Command._
def executeCommand(cmd: Command) = cmd match
    case Start | Go => println("start")
    case Stop | Whoa => println("stop")
```
As demonstrated, the ability to define multiple possible matches for each case statement can simplify your code.

## Assigning the Result of a Match Expression to a Variable
#### Problem
You want to return a value from a match expression and assign it to a variable, or use a match expression as the body of a method.

#### Solution
To assign the result of a match expression to a variable, insert the variable assignment before the expression, as with the variable evenOrOdd in this example:

```scala
val someNumber = scala.util.Random.nextInt()
val evenOrOdd = someNumber match
    case 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 => "odd"
    case 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 => "even"
    case _ => "other"
```
This approach is commonly used to create short methods or functions. For example, the following method implements the Perl definitions of true and false:

```scala
def isTrue(a: Matchable): Boolean = a match
    case 0 | "" => false
    case _ => true
```

## Accessing the Value of the Default Case in a Match Expression
#### Problem
You want to access the value of the default, “catch all” case when using a match expression, but you can’t access the value when you match it with the _ wildcard syntax.

#### Solution
Instead of using the _ wildcard character, assign a variable name to the default case:

```scala
i match
    case 0 => println("1")
    case 1 => println("2")
    case default => println(s"You gave me: $default")
```

By giving the default match a variable name, you can access the variable on the right side of the expression.

## Using Pattern Matching in Match Expressions
#### Problem
You need to match one or more patterns in a match expression, and the pattern may be a constant pattern, variable pattern, constructor pattern, sequence pattern, tuple pattern, or type pattern.

#### Solution
Define a case statement for each pattern you want to match. The following method shows examples of many different types of patterns you can use in match expressions:
```scala

def test(x: Matchable): String = x match

    // constant patterns
    case 0 => "zero"
    case true => "true"
    case "hello" => "you said 'hello'"
    case Nil => "an empty List"

    // sequence patterns
    case List(0, _, _) => "a 3-element list with 0 as the first element"
    case List(1, _*) => "list, starts with 1, has any number of elements"

    // tuples
    case (a, b) => s"got $a and $b"
    case (a, b, c) => s"got $a, $b, and $c"

    // constructor patterns
    case Person(first, "Alexander") => s"Alexander, first name = $first"
    case Dog("Suka") => "found a dog named Suka"

    // typed patterns
    case s: String => s"got a string: $s"
    case i: Int => s"got an int: $i"
    case f: Float => s"got a float: $f"
    case a: Array[Int] => s"array of int: ${a.mkString(",")}"
    case as: Array[String] => s"string array: ${as.mkString(",")}"
    case d: Dog => s"dog: ${d.name}"
    case list: List[_] => s"got a List: $list"
    case m: Map[_, _] => m.toString

    // the default wildcard pattern
    case _ => "Unknown"

end test
```
The large match expression in this method shows the different categories of patterns described in the book, Programming in Scala (Artima), by Odersky, et al, including constant patterns, sequence patterns, tuple patterns, constructor patterns, and typed patterns.

The following code demonstrates all of the cases in the match expression, with the output of each expression shown in the comments. Note that the print method is renamed on import to make the examples more concise:
```scala

import System.out.{println => p}

case class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String)
case class Dog(name: String)

// trigger the constant patterns
p(test(0))               // zero
p(test(true))            // true
p(test("hello"))         // you said 'hello'
p(test(Nil))             // an empty List

// trigger the sequence patterns
p(test(List(0,1,2)))     // a 3-element list with 0 as the first element
p(test(List(1,2)))       // list, starts with 1, has any number of elements
p(test(List(1,2,3)))     // list, starts with 1, has any number of elements
p(test(Vector(1,2,3)))   // vector, starts w/ 1, has any number of elements

// trigger the tuple patterns
p(test((1,2)))                            // got 1 and 2
p(test((1,2,3)))                          // got 1, 2, and 3

// trigger the constructor patterns
p(test(Person("Melissa", "Alexander")))   // Alexander, first name = Melissa
p(test(Dog("Suka")))                      // found a dog named Suka

// trigger the typed patterns
p(test("Hello, world"))                   // got a string: Hello, world
p(test(42))                               // got an int: 42
p(test(42F))                              // got a float: 42.0
p(test(Array(1,2,3)))                     // array of int: 1,2,3
p(test(Array("coffee", "apple pie")))     // string array: coffee,apple pie
p(test(Dog("Fido")))                      // dog: Fido
p(test(List("apple", "banana")))          // got a List: List(apple, banana)
p(test(Map(1->"Al", 2->"Alexander")))     // Map(1 -> Al, 2 -> Alexander)

// trigger the wildcard pattern
p(test("33d"))                            // you gave me this string: 33d

```

Note that in the match expression the List and Map expressions that were written like this:

```scala
case m: Map[_, _] => m.toString
case list: List[_] => s"thanks for the List: $list"
```
could have been written as this instead:

```scala
case m: Map[A, B] => m.toString
case list: List[X] => s"thanks for the List: $list"

```

I prefer the underscore syntax because it makes it clear that I’m not concerned about what’s stored in the List or Map. Actually, there are times that I might be interested in what’s stored in the List or Map, but because of type erasure in the JVM, that becomes a difficult problem.

## Adding if Expressions (Guards) to Case Statements
#### Problem
You want to add qualifying logic to a case statement in a match expression, such as allowing a range of numbers, or matching a pattern, but only if that pattern matches some additional criteria.

#### Solution
Add an if guard to your case statement. Use it to match a range of numbers:
```scala

i match
    case a if 0 to 9 contains a => println("0-9 range: " + a)
    case b if 10 to 19 contains b => println("10-19 range: " + b)
    case c if 20 to 29 contains c => println("20-29 range: " + c)
    case _ => println("Hmmm...")
```
Use it to match different values of an object:
```scala

i match
    case x if x == 1 => println("one, a lonely number")
    case x if (x == 2 || x == 3) => println(x)
    case _ => println("some other value")
```
As long as your class has an unapply method, you can reference class fields in your if guards. For instance, because a case class has an automatically-generated unapply method, given this Stock class and instance:
```scala

case class Stock(symbol: String, price: BigDecimal)
val stock = Stock("AAPL", BigDecimal(132.50))
```
you can use pattern matching and guard conditions with the class fields:
```scala

stock match
    case s if s.symbol == "AAPL" && s.price < 140 => buy(s)
    case s if s.symbol == "AAPL" && s.price > 160 => sell(s)
    case _ => // do nothing
```
You can also extract fields from case classes — and classes that have properly implemented unapply methods — and use those in your guard conditions. For example, the case statements in this match expression:
```scala

// extract the 'name' in the 'case' and then use that value
def speak(p: Person) = p match
    case Person(name) if name == "Fred" =>
        println("Yubba dubba doo")
    case Person(name) if name == "Bam Bam" =>
        println("Bam bam!")
    case _ =>
        println("Watch the Flintstones!")
```
will work if Person is defined as a case class:

    case class Person(aName: String)
or as a class with a properly-implemented unapply method:
```scala

class Person(val aName: String)
object Person:
    // 'unapply' deconstructs a Person. it’s also known as an
    // extractor, and Person is an “extractor object.”
    def unapply(p: Person): Option[String] = Some(p.aName)
```
