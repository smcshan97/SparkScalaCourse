## Using a Trait as an Interface
#### Problem
You’re used to creating pure interfaces in other languages — declaring method signatures without implementations — and want to create something like that in Scala, and then use those interfaces with concrete classes.

#### Solution
At their most basic level, Scala traits can be used like pre-Java 8 interfaces, where you define method signatures but don’t provide an implementation for them.

For example, imagine that you want to write some code to model any animal that has a tail, like a dog or cat. A first thing you might think is that tails can wag, so you define a trait like this, with two method signatures and no method body:

    trait HasTail:
        def startTail(): Unit
        def stopTail(): Unit
Those two methods don’t take any parameters. If the methods you want to define will take parameters, declare them as usual:

    trait HasLegs:
        def startRunning(speed: Double): Unit
        def runForNSeconds(speed: Double, numSeconds: Int): Unit
EXTENDING TRAITS
On the flip side of this process, when you want to create a class that extends a trait, use the extends keyword:

    class Dog extends HasTail
When a class extends multiple traits, use extends for the first trait, and separate subsequent traits with commas:

    class Dog extends HasTail, HasLegs, HasRubberyNose
If a class extends a trait but doesn’t implement all of its abstract methods, the class must be declared abstract:

    abstract class Dog extends HasTail, HasLegs:
        // does not implement methods from HasTail or HasLegs so
        // it must be declared abstract
But if the class provides an implementation for all of the abstract methods of the traits it extends, it can be declared as a normal class:

    class Dog extends HasTail, HasLegs:
        def startTail(): Unit = println("Tail is wagging")
        def stopTail(): Unit = println("Tail is stopped")
        def startRunning(speed: Double): Unit =
            println(s"Running at $speed miles/hour")
        def runForNSeconds(speed: Double, numSeconds: Int): Unit =
            println(s"Running at $speed miles/hour for $numSeconds seconds")

## Defining Abstract Fields in Traits
#### Problem
You want to declare that a trait should have a field, but you don’t want to give the field an initial value, i.e., you want it to be abstract.

#### Solution
Over time, Scala developers have learned that the simplest and most flexible way to define abstract fields in traits is to use a def:

    trait PizzaTrait:
        def maxNumToppings: Int
This lets you override the field in the classes (and traits) that extend your trait in a variety of ways, including as a val:

    class SmallPizza extends PizzaTrait:
        val maxNumToppings = 4
As a lazy val:

    class SmallPizza extends PizzaTrait:
        lazy val maxNumToppings =
            // some long-running operation
            Thread.sleep(1000)
            4
As a var:

    class MediumPizza extends PizzaTrait:
        var maxNumToppings = 6
Or as a def:

    class LargePizza extends PizzaTrait:
        def maxNumToppings: Int =
            // some algorithm here
            42

## Using a Trait Like an Abstract Class
#### Problem
You want to use a trait as something like an abstract class in Java, defining both abstract and concrete methods.

#### Solution
Define both concrete and abstract methods in your trait as desired. In classes that extend the trait you can override both types of methods, or, for the concrete methods, you can inherit the default behavior defined in the trait.

In the following example, a default, concrete implementation is provided for the speak method in the Pet trait, so implementing classes don’t have to override it. The Dog class chooses not to override it, whereas the Cat class does. Both classes must implement the comeToMaster method because it has no implementation in the Pet trait:

    trait Pet:
        def speak() = println("Yo")   // concrete implementation
        def comeToMaster(): Unit      // abstract method

    class Dog extends Pet:
        // no need to implement `speak` if you don’t want to
        def comeToMaster() = println("I'm coming!")

    class Cat extends Pet:
        override def speak() = println("meow")
        def comeToMaster() = println("That’s not gonna happen.")
If a class extends a trait without implementing its abstract methods, it must be declared to be abstract. Because FlyingPet doesn’t implement comeToMaster, it must be declared abstract:

    abstract class FlyingPet extends Pet:
        def fly() = println("Woo-hoo, I’m flying!")

## Using Traits as Mixins
#### Problem
You want to design a solution where one or more traits can be mixed into a class to provide a robust design.

#### Solution
To use traits as mixins, define the methods in your traits as abstract or concrete methods, as usual, and then “mix” the traits into your classes using extends. This can be done in at least two different ways:

Constructing a class with traits

Mix-in traits during variable construction

These approaches are discussed in the following sections.

CONSTRUCTING A CLASS WITH TRAITS
A first approach is to create a class while extending one or more traits. For example, imagine that you have these two traits:

    trait HasTail:
        def wagTail() = println("Tail is wagging")
        def stopTail() = println("Tail is stopped")

    trait Pet:
        def speak() = println("Yo")
        def comeToMaster(): Unit   // abstract
The methods in HasTail are both concrete, while the comeToMaster method in Pet is abstract because the method has no body. Now you can create a concrete Dog class by mixing-in those traits and implementing comeToMaster:

    class Dog(val name: String) extends Pet, HasTail:
        def comeToMaster() = println("Woo-hoo, I'm coming!")

    val d = Dog("Zeus")
Using the same approach, you can also create a Cat class that implements comeToMaster differently, while also overriding speak:

    class Cat(val name: String) extends Pet, HasTail:
        def comeToMaster() = println("That’s not gonna happen.")
        override def speak() = println("meow")

    val c = Cat("Morris")
MIX-IN TRAITS DURING VARIABLE CONSTRUCTION
Another mixin approach is to add traits to a class at the same time as you create a variable. Imagine that you now have these three traits (which have no methods) and a Pet class:

    trait HasLegs
    trait HasTail
    trait MansBestFriend
    class Pet(val name: String)
Now you can create a new Pet instance while also mixing in the traits you want for this particular variable:

    val zeus = new Pet("Zeus") with MansBestFriend with HasTail with HasLegs
Then you can create other variables by mixing in the traits that make sense:

    val cat = new Pet("Morris") with HasTail with HasLegs

## Resolving Method Name Conflicts and Understanding super
#### Problem
You attempt to create a class that mixes in multiple traits, but those traits have identical method names and parameter lists, resulting in a compiler error.

#### Solution
When two or more mixed-in traits share the same method name, the solution is to resolve the conflict manually. This can require understanding the meaning of super when referring to mixed-in traits.

As an example, imagine that you have two traits that both have a greet method:

    trait Hello:
        def greet = "hello"

    trait Hi:
        def greet = "hi"
Now if you attempt to create a Greeter class that mixes in both traits:

class Greeter extends Hello, Hi
you’ll see an error like this:

   class Greeter extends Hello, Hi
         ^
    class Greeter inherits conflicting members:
           |method greet in trait Hello of type   |=> String  and
           |method greet in trait Hi of type      |=> String
(Note: this can be resolved by declaring an override in class Greeter.)
The error message tells you the solution — that you can override greet in the Greeter class. But it doesn’t give you details on how to do this.

There are three main solutions, all of which require that you override greet in Greeter:

Override greet with custom behavior.

Tell greet in Greeter to call the greet method from super, which raises the question, “What does super refer to when you’re mixing in multiple traits?”

Tell greet in Greeter to use the greet method from a specific trait that was mixed-in.

The next sections cover each solution in detail.

(1) OVERRIDE GREET WITH CUSTOM BEHAVIOR
The first solution is to ignore the methods defined in the traits and implement some custom behavior by overriding the method:

    // resolve the conflict by overriding 'greet' in the class
    class Greeter extends Hello, Hi:
        override def greet = "I greet thee!"

    // the 'greet' method override works as expected
    val g = Greeter()
    g.greet == "I greet thee!"   // true
This is a simple, straightforward solution for the situations where you don’t care how the traits have implemented this method.

(2) INVOKE GREET USING SUPER
The second solution is to invoke the method as its defined in your immediate parent, i.e., the super instance. In this code the speak method in the Speaker class invokes super.speak:

    trait Parent:
        def speak = "make your bed"
    trait Granddad:
        def speak = "get off my lawn"

    // resolve the conflict by calling 'super.speak'
    class Speaker extends Parent, Granddad:
        override def speak = super.speak

    @main def callSuperSpeak =
        println((new Speaker).speak)
The question is, what does super.speak print?

The answer is that super.speak prints, "get off my lawn". In an example like this where a class mixes in multiple traits — and those traits have no mixin or inheritance relationships between themselves — super will always refer to the last trait that is mixed in. This is referred to as a “back to front” linearization order.

(3) CONTROL WHICH SUPER YOU CALL
In the third solution you specify which mixed-in trait’s method you want to call with a super[classname].methodName syntax. For instance, given these three traits:

    trait Hello:
        def greet = "hello"
    trait Hi:
        def greet = "hi"
    trait Yo:
        def greet = "yo"
You can create a Greeter class that mixes in those traits and then defines a series of “greet” methods that call the greet methods of those traits:

    class Greeter extends Hello, Hi, Yo:
        override def greet = super.greet
        def greetHello = super[Hello].greet
        def greetHi    = super[Hi].greet
        def greetYo    = super[Yo].greet
    end Greeter
You can test that configuration with this code in the REPL:

    val g = Greeter()
    g.greet        // yo
    g.greetHello   // hello
    g.greetHi      // hi
    g.greetYo      // yo
The key to this solution is that the super[Hello].greet syntax gives you a way to reference the hello method of the Hello trait, and so on for the Hi and Yo traits.

## Marking Traits So They Can Only Be Used by Subclasses of a Certain Type
#### Problem
You want to mark your trait so it can only be used by types that extend a given base type.

#### Solution
To make sure a trait named MyTrait can only be mixed into a class that is a subclass of a type named BaseType, begin your trait with this syntax:

    trait MyTrait:
        this: BaseType =>
For instance, to make sure a StarfleetWarpCore can only be mixed into a class that also mixes in FederationStarship, begin the StarfleetWarpCore trait like this:

    trait StarfleetWarpCore:
        this: FederationStarship =>
        // the rest of the trait here ...
Given that declaration, this code compiles:

    // this compiles, as desired
    trait FederationStarship
    class Enterprise extends FederationStarship, StarfleetWarpCore
But other attempts like this will fail:

    class RomulanShip

    // this won’t compile
    class Warbird extends RomulanShip, StarfleetWarpCore
          ^
    illegal inheritance: self type
    Warbird of class Warbird does not conform to self type
    FederationStarship of parent trait StarfleetWarpCore

    Explanation: You mixed in trait StarfleetWarpCore which requires self
    type FederationStarship

## Ensuring a Trait Can Only Be Added to a Type That Has a Specific Method
#### Problem
You only want to allow a trait to be mixed into a type (class, abstract class, or trait) that has a method with a given signature.

#### Solution
Use a variation of the self-type syntax that lets you declare that any class that attempts to mix in the trait must implement the method you describe.

In the following example, the WarpCore trait requires that any class that attempts to mix it in must have an ejectWarpCore method with the signature shown, taking a String parameter and returning a Boolean value:

    trait WarpCore:
        this: { def ejectWarpCore(password: String): Boolean } =>
        // more trait code here ...
The following definition of the Enterprise class meets these requirements, and therefore compiles:

    class Starship:
        // code here ...

    class Enterprise extends Starship, WarpCore:
        def ejectWarpCore(password: String): Boolean =
            if password == "password" then
                println("ejecting core!")
                true
            else
                false
            end if

## Limiting Which Classes Can Use a Trait by Inheritance
#### Problem
You want to limit a trait so it can only be added to classes that extend a specific superclass.

#### Solution
Use the following syntax to declare a trait named TraitName, where TraitName can only be mixed into classes that extend a type named SuperClass, where SuperClass may be a class or abstract class:

    trait TraitName extends SuperClass
For example, in modeling a large pizza store chain that has a corporate office and many small retail stores, the legal department creates a rule that people who deliver pizzas to customers must be a subclass of StoreEmployee and cannot be a subclass of CorporateEmployee. To enforce this, begin by defining your base classes:

    trait Employee
    class CorporateEmployee extends Employee
    class StoreEmployee extends Employee
Because someone who delivers food can only be a StoreEmployee, you enforce this requirement in the DeliversFood trait:

    trait DeliversFood extends StoreEmployee
                       ---------------------
Now you can successfully define a DeliveryPerson class like this:

    // this is allowed
    class DeliveryPerson extends StoreEmployee, DeliversFood
But because the DeliversFood trait can only be mixed into classes that extend StoreEmployee, the following line of code won’t compile:

    // won’t compile
    class Receptionist extends CorporateEmployee, DeliversFood
The compiler error message looks like this:

illegal trait inheritance: superclass CorporateEmployee
does not derive from trait DeliversFood's super class StoreEmployee
This makes the people in the legal department happy.

#### Discussion
I don’t use this technique very often, but when you need to limit which classes a trait can be mixed into by requiring a specific superclass, this is an effective technique.

Note that this approach does not work when CorporateEmployee and StoreEmployee are traits instead of classes. When you need to use this approach with traits, see Recipe 6.6.

## Working with Parameterized Traits
#### Problem
As you become more advanced in working with types, you want to write a trait whose methods can be applied to generic types, or limited to other specific types.

#### Solution
Depending on your needs you can use type parameters or type members with traits. This example shows what a generic trait type parameter looks like:

    trait Stringify[A]:
        def string(a: A): String
This example shows what a type member looks like:

    trait Stringify:
        type A
        def string(a: A): String
Here’s a complete type parameter example:

    trait Stringify[A]:
        def string(a: A): String = s"value: ${a.toString}"

    @main def typeParameter =
        object StringifyInt extends Stringify[Int]
        println(StringifyInt.string(100))
And here’s the same example written using a type member:

    trait Stringify:
        type A
        def string(a: A): String

    object StringifyInt extends Stringify:
        type A = Int
        def string(i: Int): String = s"value: ${i.toString}"

    @main def typeMember =
        println(StringifyInt.string(42))
Dependent types
The free book, The Type Astronaut’s Guide to Shapeless, by Dave Gurnell, shows an example where a type parameter and type member are used in combination to create something known as a dependent type.

#### Discussion
With the type parameter approach you can specify multiple types. For example, this is a Scala implementation of the Java Pair interface that’s shown on this Oracle Generic Types page:

    trait Pair[A, B]:
        def getKey: A
        def getValue: B
That demonstrates the use of two generic parameters in a small trait example.

An advantage of parameterizing traits using either technique is that you can prevent things from happening that should never happen. For instance, given this trait and class hierarchy:

    sealed trait Dog
    class LittleDog extends Dog
    class BigDog extends Dog
you can define another trait with a type member like this:

    trait Barker:
        type D <: Dog   //type member
        def bark(d: D): Unit
Now you can define an object with a bark method for little dogs:

    object LittleBarker extends Barker:
        type D = LittleDog
        def bark(d: D) = println("wuf")
and you can define another object with a bark method for big dogs:

    object BigBarker extends Barker:
        type D = BigDog
        def bark(d: D) = println("WOOF!")
Now when you create these instances:

    val terrier = LittleDog()
    val husky = BigDog()
    this code will compile:

    LittleBarker.bark(terrier)
    BigBarker.bark(husky)
and this code won’t compile, as desired:

    // won’t work, compiler error
    // BigBarker.bark(terrier)
This demonstrates how a type member can declare a base type in the initial trait, and how more specific types can be applied in the traits, classes, and objects that extend that base type.

## Using Trait Parameters
#### Problem
In Scala 3, you want to create a trait that takes one or more parameters, in the same way that a class or abstract class takes constructor parameters.

#### Solution
In Scala 3 a trait can have parameters, just like a class or abstract class. For instance, here’s an example of a Scala 3 trait that accepts a parameter:

trait Pet(val name: String)
However, per the Scala 3 Trait Parameters specification, there are limits on how this feature can be used:

A trait T can have one or more parameters

A trait T1 can extend T, so long as it does not pass parameters to T

If a class C extends T, and its superclass does not, C must pass arguments to T

If a class C extends T, and its superclass does as well, C may not pass arguments to T

Getting back to the example, once you have a trait that accepts a parameter, a class can extend it like this:

    trait Pet(val name: String)

    // a class can extend a trait with a parameter
    class Dog(override val name: String) extends Pet(name):
        override def toString = s"dog name: $name"

    // use the Dog class
    val d = Dog("Fido")
Later in your code, another class can also extend the Dog class:

    class SiberianHusky(override val name: String) extends Dog(name)
In a world where all cats are named “Morris,” a class can also extend a trait with parameters like this:

    class Cat extends Pet("Morris"):
        override def toString = s"Cat: $name"

    // use the Cat class
    val c = Cat()
These examples show how traits are used in the first, third, and fourth bullet points above.

ONE TRAIT CAN EXTEND ANOTHER, WITH LIMITS
Next, as stated in the second bullet point, a trait can extend another trait that takes one or more parameters so long as it does not pass a parameter to it. Therefore, this attempt fails:

    // won’t compile
    trait Echidna(override val name: String) extends Pet(name)
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^
                           trait Echidna may not call constructor of trait Pet
And this attempt, which does not attempt to pass a parameter to Pet, succeeds:

    // works
    trait FeatheredPet extends Pet
Then, when a class later extends FeatheredPet, the correct approach is to write your code like this:

    class Bird(override val name: String) extends Pet(name), FeatheredPet:
        override def toString = s"bird name: $name"

    // create a new Bird
    val b = Bird("Tweety")
#### Discussion
In this solution there’s a subtle distinction between these two approaches:

    trait Pet(val name: String)   // shown in the Solution
    trait Pet(name: String)
When val is not used, name is a simple parameter, but it provides no “getter” method. When val is used, it provides a getter for name, and everything shown in the Solution works as shown.

When you leave val off of the name field in Pet, all of the following code works as before, except the Cat class, which will not compile:

    trait Pet(name: String):
        override def toString = s"Pet: $name"
    trait FeatheredPet extends Pet

    // `override` is not needed on these parameters
    class Bird(val name: String) extends Pet(name), FeatheredPet:
        override def toString = s"Bird: $name"
    class Dog(val name: String) extends Pet(name):
        override def toString = s"Dog: $name"
    class SiberianHusky(override val name: String) extends Dog(name)

    // this will not compile
    class Cat extends Pet("Morris"):
        override def toString = s"Cat: $name"
The Cat approach doesn’t compile because the name parameter in the Pet class isn’t defined as a val; therefore there is no getter method for it. Again, this is a subtle point, and how you define the initial field depends on how you want to access name in the future.

Trait parameters were added to Scala 3 at least in part to help eliminate a Scala 2 feature known as “early initializers” or “early definitions.” Somewhere in Scala 2 history, someone found out that you could write code like this:

    // this is Scala 2 code. start with a normal trait.
    trait Pet {
        def name: String
        val nameLength = name.length   // note: this is based on `name`
    }

    // notice the unusual approach of initializing a variable after 'extends' and
    // before 'with'. this is a Scala 2 “early initializer” technique:
    class Dog extends {
        val name = "Xena, the Princess Warrior"
    } with Pet

    val d = new Dog
    d.name         // Xena, the Princess Warrior
    d.nameLength   // 26
The purpose of this approach was to make sure that name is initialized early, so the nameLength expression won’t throw a NullPointerException. Conversely, if you wrote the code like this, it will throw a NullPointerException when you try to create a new Dog:

    // this is also Scala 2 code
    trait Pet {
        def name: String
        val nameLength = name.length
    }

    class Dog extends Pet {
        val name = "Xena, the Princess Warrior"
    }

    val d = new Dog  //java.lang.NullPointerException
I never used this “early initializer” feature in Scala 2, but it’s known to be hard to implement properly, so it’s eliminated in Scala 3, and replaced by trait parameters.

Also note that trait parameters have no effect on how traits are initialized. Given these traits:

    trait A(val a: String):
        println(s"A: $a")
    trait B extends A:
        println(s"B: $a")
    trait C:
        println(s"C")
The following classes D and E show that the traits can be specified in any order when they are mixed in:

    class D(override val a: String) extends A(a), B, C
    class E(override val a: String) extends C, B, A(a)
The output of creating new instances of D and E is shown in the REPL:

    scala> D("d")
    A: d
    B: d
    C

    scala> E("e")
    C
    A: e
    B: e
As shown, the traits can be listed in any order.
