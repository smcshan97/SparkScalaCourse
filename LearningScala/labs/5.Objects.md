## Casting Objects
####Problem
You need to cast an instance of a class from one type to another, such as when creating objects dynamically.

#### Solution
In the following example I’ll work with the Sphinx-4 speech recognition library, which works in a manner similar to creating beans in the Spring Framework. In the example, the object returned by the lookup method is cast to an instance of a class named Recognizer:

    val recognizer = cm.lookup("recognizer").asInstanceOf[Recognizer]
This Scala code is equivalent to the following Java code:

Recognizer recognizer = (Recognizer)cm.lookup("recognizer");
The asInstanceOf method is defined in the Scala Any class, and is therefore available on all objects.

## Passing a Class Type with the classOf Method
#### Problem
When an API requires that you pass in a Class type, you’d call .class on an object in Java, but that doesn’t work in Scala.

#### Solution
Use the Scala classOf method instead of Java’s .class. The following example from a Java Sound API project shows how to pass a class of type TargetDataLine to a method named DataLine.Info:

    val info = DataLine.Info(classOf[TargetDataLine], null)
By contrast, the same method call would be made like this in Java:

    // java
    info = new DataLine.Info(TargetDataLine.class, null);
The classOf method is defined in the Scala Predef object and is therefore available without requiring an import.

## Creating Singletons with object
#### Problem
You want to create a Singleton object to ensure that only one instance of a class exists.

#### Solution
Create Singleton objects in Scala with the object keyword. For instance, you might create a Singleton object to represent something you only want one instance of, such as a keyboard, mouse, or perhaps a cash register in a pizza restaurant:

    object CashRegister:
        def open() = println("opened")
        def close() = println("closed")
With CashRegister defined as an object, there can be only one instance of it, and its methods are called just like static methods on a Java class:

    @main def Main =
        CashRegister.open()
        CashRegister.close()

## Creating “Static” Members with Companion Objects
#### Problem
You’ve come to Scala from a language like Java, and want to create a class that has both instance and static members, but Scala doesn’t have a static keyword.

#### Solution
When you want non-static (instance) members in a class combined with static members, define the instance members in a class and define the members that you want to appear as “static” members in an object that has the same name as the class, and is in the same file as the class. This object is known as the class’s companion object (and the class is known as the object’s companion class).

Using this approach lets you create what appear to be static members on a class, as shown in this example:

    // Pizza class
    class Pizza (var crustType: String):
        override def toString = s"Crust type is $crustType"

    // companion object
    object Pizza:
        val CRUST_TYPE_THIN = "THIN"    // static fields
        val CRUST_TYPE_THICK = "THICK"
        def getPrice = 0.0              // static method
With the Pizza class and Pizza object defined in the same file, members of the Pizza object can be accessed just as static members of a Java class:

    println(Pizza.CRUST_TYPE_THIN)   // THIN
    println(Pizza.getPrice)          // 0.0
You can also create a new Pizza instance and use it as usual:

    val p = Pizza(Pizza.CRUST_TYPE_THICK)
    println(p)   // "Crust type is THICK"

## Using apply Methods in Objects as Constructors
#### Problem
In some situations it may be better, easier, or more convenient to create apply methods in a companion object to work as a class constructor, and you want to understand how to write these methods.

#### Solution
The techniques in Recipe 5.2 and Recipe 5.4 show how to create both single and multiple class constructors. But another technique you can use to create “constructors” is to define apply methods in a class’s companion object — an object that has the same name as the class, and is defined in the same file as the class. Technically these aren’t constructors, they’re more like functions or factory methods, but they serve a similar purpose.

Creating a companion object with an apply method takes just a few steps. Assuming that you want to create constructors for a Person class:

Define a Person class and Person object in the same file (making them companions)

Make the Person class constructor private

Define one or more apply methods in the object to serve as builders of the class

For the first two steps, create the class and object in the same file, and make the Person class constructor private:

    class Person private(val name: String):
        // define any instance members you need here

    object Person:
        // define any static members you need here
Then create one or more apply methods in the companion object:

    class Person private(val name: String):
        override def toString = name

    object Person:
        // the “constructor”
        def apply(name: String): Person = new Person(name)
Given this code, you can now create new Person instances, as shown in these examples:

    val Regina = Person("Regina")
    val a = List(Person("Regina"), Person("Robert"))
In Scala 2 a benefit of this approach was that it eliminated the need for the new keyword before the class name. But because new isn’t needed in most situations in Scala 3, you may want to use this technique because you prefer this “factory” approach, or because you need it in one of those rare situations.

## Implementing a Static Factory with apply
#### Problem
To keep object creation logic in one location, you want to implement a “Static Factory” in Scala.

#### Solution
A static factory is a simplified version of the Factory Pattern. To create a static factory, you can take advantage of Scala’s syntactic sugar and create the factory with an apply method in an object, typically a companion object.

For instance, suppose you want to create an Animal factory that returns instances of Cat and Dog classes, based on what you ask for. By writing an apply method in the companion object of an Animal trait, users of your factory can create new Cat and Dog instances like this:

    val cat = Animal("cat")   // creates a Cat
    val dog = Animal("dog")   // creates a Dog
To implement this behavior, create a file named Animals.scala, and in that file create (a) a parent Animal trait, (b) the classes that extend that trait, and (c) a companion object with a suitable apply method:

    package animals

    sealed trait Animal:
        def speak(): Unit

    private class Dog extends Animal:
        override def speak() = println("woof")

    private class Cat extends Animal:
        override def speak() = println("meow")

    object Animal:
        // the factory method
        def apply(s: String): Animal =
            if (s == "dog") new Dog else new Cat
Next, in a file named Factory.scala, define a main method to test that code:

    @main def test1 =
        import animals._

        val cat = Animal("cat")   // returns a Cat
        val dog = Animal("dog")   // returns a Dog

        cat.speak()
        dog.speak()
When you run that code you see this output:

    meow
    woof
A benefit of this approach is that instances of the Dog and Cat classes can only be created through the factory method. Attempting to create them directly will fail:

    val c = Cat()   // compile error
    val d = Dog()   // compile error

## Reifying Traits as Objects
#### Problem
You’ve created one or more traits that contain methods, and now you want to make them concrete. Or, perhaps you’ve seen code like this, and then wondered what that last line of code is all about:

    trait Foo:
        println("Foo")
        // more code ...

    object Foo extends Foo
#### Solution
When you see that an object extends one or more traits, the object is being used to reify the trait(s). The word “reify” means, “to take an abstract concept and making it concrete,” in this case instantiating a singleton object from one or more traits.

For instance, given this trait and two classes that extend it:

    trait Animal

    // in a world where all dogs and cats have names
    case class Dog(name: String) extends Animal
    case class Cat(name: String) extends Animal
In a functional programming style you might also create a set of “animal services” as a trait:

    // assumes that all animal have legs
    trait AnimalServices:
        def walk(a: Animal) = println(s"$a is walking")
        def run(a: Animal)  = println(s"$a is running")
        def stop(a: Animal) = println(s"$a is stopped")
Once you have a trait like this, the next thing many developers do is to reify the AnimalServices trait as an object:

    object AnimalServices extends AnimalServices
Now you can use the AnimalServices functions:

    val zeus = Dog("Zeus")
    AnimalServices.walk(zeus)
    AnimalServices.run(zeus)
    AnimalServices.stop(zeus)
