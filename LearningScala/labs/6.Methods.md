## Controlling Method Scope (Access Modifiers)
#### Problem
Scala methods are public by default, and you want to control their scope.

#### Solution
Scala lets you control method visibility in a granular and powerful way. In order from “most restrictive” to “most open,” Scala provides these scope options:

Private scope

Protected scope

Package scope

Package-specific scope

Public scope

These scopes are demonstrated in the examples that follow.

private[this] and protected[this]
Scala 2 has a notion of private[this] and protected[this] scope qualifiers, but those have been deprecated. See the Scala 3 page, Dropped: private-this and protected-this for a discussion of those features.

PRIVATE SCOPE
The most restrictive access is to mark a method private, which makes the method available to (a) the current instance of a class and (b) other instances of the current class. This code shows how to mark a method as private, and how it can be used by another instance of the same class:

    class Cat:
        private def isFriendlyCat = true
        def sampleMethod(other: Cat) =
            if other.isFriendlyCat then
                println("Can access other.isFriendlyCat")
                // ...
            end if
        end sampleMethod
    end Cat
When a method is marked private it’s not available to subclasses. The following Dog class won’t compile because the heartBeat method is private to the Animal class:

    class Animal:
        private def heartBeat() = println("Animal heart is beating")

    class Dog extends Animal:
        heartBeat()   // ERROR: Not found: heartBeat
To make the method available to the Dog class, use protected scope.

PROTECTED SCOPE
Marking a method protected modifies its scope so it (a) can be accessed by other instances of the same class, (b) is not visible in the current package, and (c) is available to subclasses. The following code demonstrates these points:

    class Cat:
        protected def isFriendlyCat = true
        def catFoo(otherCat: Cat) =
            if otherCat.isFriendlyCat then   // this compiles
                println("Can access 'otherCat.isFriendlyCat'")
                // ...
            end if

    @main def CatTests =
        val c1 = Cat()
        val c2 = Cat()
        c1.catFoo(c2)         // this works

        // this code can’t access this method:
        // c1.isFriendlyCat   // does not compile
In that code:

The if other.isFriendlyCat expression in catFoo shows that one Cat instance can access isFriendlyCat in another instance

The c1.catFoo(c2) expression demonstrates that one Cat instance can call catFoo on another instance, and catFoo can invoke isFriendlyCat on that other instance

The commented-out c1.isFriendlyCat shows that one Cat instance can’t directly invoke isFriendlyCat on another Cat instance; protected doesn’t allow that, even though CatHouse is in the same package as Cat

Because protected methods are available to subclasses, the following code also compiles:

    class Animal:
        protected def heartBeat() = println("Animal heart is beating")

    class Dog extends Animal:
        heartBeat()   // this
PACKAGE SCOPE
To make a method so that it’s only available to all members of the current package, mark the method as being private to the current package with the private[packageName] syntax.

In the following example, the method privateModelMethod can be accessed by other classes in the same package — the model package — but privateMethod and protectedMethod can’t be accessed:

    package com.devdaily.coolapp.model:
        class Foo:
            // this is in “package scope”
            private[model] def privateModelMethod = ??? // can be accessed by
                                                        // classes in
                                                        // com.devdaily.coolapp.model
            private def privateMethod = ???
            protected def protectedMethod = ???

        class Bar:
            val f = Foo()
            f.privateModelMethod   // compiles
            // f.privateMethod     // won’t compile
            // f.protectedMethod   // won’t compile
PACKAGE-SPECIFIC SCOPE
Beyond making a method available to classes in the current package, Scala also allows a fine-grained level of access control that lets you make a method available at different levels in a class hierarchy. The following example demonstrates how you can make the methods doUnderModel, doUnderCoolapp, and doUnderAcme available to different package levels:

    package com.devdaily.coolapp.model:
        class Foo:
            // available under com.devdaily.coolapp.model
            private[model] def doUnderModel = ???

            // available under com.devdaily.coolapp
            private[coolapp] def doUnderCoolapp = ???

            // available under com.devdaily
            private[devdaily] def doUnderAcme = ???

    import com.devdaily.coolapp.model.Foo

    package com.devdaily.coolapp.view:
        class Bar:
            val f = Foo()
            // f.doUnderModel  // won’t compile
            f.doUnderCoolapp
            f.doUnderAcme

    package com.devdaily.common:
        class Bar:
            val f = Foo()
            // f.doUnderModel     // won’t compile
            // f.doUnderCoolapp   // won’t compile
            f.doUnderAcme
In this example, the methods can be seen as follows:

The method doUnderModel can be seen by other classes in the model package (com.devdaily.coolapp.model)

The method doUnderCoolapp can be seen by all classes under the com.devdaily.coolapp package level

The method doUnderAcme can be seen by all classes under the com.devdaily level

PUBLIC SCOPE
If no access modifier is added to a method declaration, the method is public, meaning that any piece of code in any package can access it. In the following example, any class in any package can access the doPublic method:

    package com.devdaily.coolapp.model:
        class Foo:
            def doPublic = ???

    package some.other.scope:
        class Bar:
            val f = com.devdaily.coolapp.model.Foo()
            f.doPublic

## Calling a Method on a Superclass or Trait
#### Problem
To keep your code DRY (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”), you want to invoke a method that’s already defined in a parent class or trait.

#### Solution
There are several possible situations which need to be accounted for in this recipe:

A method in a class does not have the same name as a superclass method, and wants to call that superclass method

A method in a class with the same name as a superclass method needs to call that superclass method

A method in a class has the same name as multiple traits that it extends, and you want to choose which trait behavior to use

The solutions for these problems are shown in the following sections.

WALKTHENRUN CALLS WALK AND RUN
When a method in a class needs to invoke a method of a superclass, and the method name in the class is different than the name in the superclass, call the superclass method without using super:

    class AnimalWithLegs:
        def walk() = println("I’m walking")
        def run() = println("I’m running")

    class Dog extends AnimalWithLegs:
        def walkThenRun() =
            walk()
            run()
In this example the method walkThenRun in the Dog class calls the walk and run methods that are defined in AnimalWithLegs. Because the method names are different, there’s no need to use a super reference. This is normal inheritance of methods in object-oriented programming.

While I show a superclass in this example, this discussion holds the same if AnimalWithLegs is a trait.

A WALK METHOD NEEDS TO CALL SUPER.WALK
When a method in a class has the same name as the method in the superclass, and you want to invoke the superclass method, define the class method with override, and then invoke the superclass method using super:

    class AnimalWithLegs:
        // the superclass 'walk' method.
        def walk() = println("Animal is walking")

    class Dog extends AnimalWithLegs:
        // the subclass 'walk' method.
        override def walk() =
            super.walk()                // invoke the superclass method.
            println("Dog is walking")   // add your own body.
In this example, the walk method in Dog has the same name as the method in the superclass, so it’s necessary to use super.walk to invoke the superclass walk method.

Now when you create a new Dog and invoke its walk method, you’ll see that both lines are printed:

    val d = Dog()
    d.walk()

    // output:
    Animal is walking
    Dog is walking
In this situation, if you don’t want the superclass walk behavior — you just want to override it — don’t call the superclass method; just define your own method body:

    class Dog extends AnimalWithLegs:
        override def walk() =
            println("Dog is walking")
Now when you create a new Dog instance and call its walk method, you’ll only see this output:

    Dog is walking
As with the previous example, this discussion is the same if AnimalWithLegs is a trait.

CONTROLLING WHICH TRAIT YOU CALL A METHOD FROM
If your class inherits from multiple traits, and those traits implement the same method, you can select not only a method name, but also a trait name when invoking a method using super. For instance, given these traits:

    trait Human:
        def yo = "Human"

    trait Mother extends Human:
        override def yo = "Mother"

    trait Father extends Human:
        override def yo = "Father"
The following code shows different ways to invoke the hello methods from the traits the Child class inherits from:

    class Child extends Human, Mother, Father:
        def printSuper  = super.yo
        def printMother = super[Mother].yo
        def printFather = super[Father].yo
        def printHuman  = super[Human].yo
When you create a new Child instance and call its methods, you’ll see this output:

    val c = Child()
    println(c.printSuper)    // Father
    println(c.printMother)   // Mother
    println(c.printFather)   // Father
    println(c.printHuman)    // Human
As shown, when a class inherits from multiple traits, and those traits have a common method name, you can choose which trait to run the method from with the super[traitName].methodName syntax. Also note that c.printSuper prints Father, because traits are constructed from left to right, and Father is the last trait mixed into Child:

    class Child extends Human, Mother, Father:
                                   ------
When using this technique you can’t continue to reach up through the parent class hierarchy unless you directly extend the target class or trait using the extends keyword. For instance, the following code won’t compile because this Child doesn’t directly extend the Human trait:

    class Child extends Mother, Father:      // removed `Human`
        def printSuper  = super.yo
        def printMother = super[Mother].yo
        def printFather = super[Father].yo
        def printHuman  = super[Human].yo    // won’t compile
When you try to compile the code you get the error, “Human does not name a parent of class Child.”

## Using Parameter Names When Calling a Method
#### Problem
You prefer a coding style where you specify the method parameter names when calling a method.

#### Solution
The general syntax for calling a method with named parameters is this:

    methodName(param1=value1, param2=value2, ...)
This is demonstrated in the following example. Given this Pizza class definition:

    enum CrustSize:
        case Small, Medium, Large

    enum CrustType:
        case Regular, Thin, Thick

    import CrustSize._, CrustType._

    class Pizza:
        var crustSize = Medium
        var crustType = Regular
        def update(crustSize: CrustSize, crustType: CrustType) =
            this.crustSize = crustSize
            this.crustType = crustType
        override def toString = s"A $crustSize inch, $crustType crust pizza."
You can create a Pizza:

    val p = Pizza()
You can then update the Pizza, specifying the parameter names and corresponding values when you call the update method:

    p.update(crustSize = Large, crustType = Thick)
This approach has the added benefit that you can place the parameters in any order:

    p.update(crustType = Thick, crustSize = Large)
Although this approach is more verbose than not using named parameters, it can also be more readable.

## Setting Default Values for Method Parameters
#### Problem
You want to set default values for method parameters so the method can optionally be called without those parameters having to be assigned.

#### Solution
Specify the default value for parameters inside the method signature with this syntax:

    parameterName: parameterType = defaultValue
For example, in the following code the timeout field is assigned a default value of 5_000 and the protocol field is given a default value of "http":

    class Connection:
        def makeConnection(timeout: Int = 5_000, protocol: String = "https") =
            println(f"timeout = ${timeout}%d, protocol = ${protocol}%s")
            // more code here
When you have a Connection instance c, this method can be called in the following ways, with the results shown in the comments:

    val c = Connection()

    c.makeConnection()                 // timeout = 5000, protocol = https
    c.makeConnection(2_000)            // timeout = 2000, protocol = https
    c.makeConnection(3_000, "http")    // timeout = 3000, protocol = http
If you like to call methods while supplying the names of the method parameters, makeConnection can also be called in these ways, as shown in Recipe 8.3:

    c.makeConnection(timeout=10_000)
    c.makeConnection(protocol="http")
    c.makeConnection(timeout=10_000, protocol="http")
    c.makeConnection(protocol="http", timeout=10_000)
As that shows, these two recipes can be used hand-in-hand to create readable code that can be useful in certain situations.

## Creating Methods That Take Variable-Argument Fields
#### Problem
To make a method more flexible, you want to define a method parameter that can take a variable number of arguments, i.e., a varargs field.

#### Solution
Define a varargs field in your method declaration by adding a * character after the field type:

    def printAll(strings: String*) =
        strings.foreach(println)
Given that declaration, printAll can now be called with zero or more parameters:

    // these all work
    printAll()
    printAll("a")
    printAll("a", "b")
    printAll("a", "b", "c")
USE _* TO ADAPT A SEQUENCE
By default you can’t pass a sequence — List, Seq, Vector, etc. — into a varargs parameter, but you can use Scala’s _* operator to adapt a sequence so it can be used as an argument for a varargs field:

    val fruits = List("apple", "banana", "cherry")

    printAll(fruits)       // fails (Found: List[String]), Required: String)
    printAll(fruits: _*)   // works
